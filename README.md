# SpartaClasswork
This repository contains all the work I did during the engineering stream of the SDET course in Sparta Global. The code will mainly consist of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Introduction
The repository is seperated into two main folders, classwork and homework. The classwork folder contains a lot of code that are either walkthroughs by trainers or labs which were either done individually or in small groups. 

The homework folders will contain all the work that were set by the trainers and done individually by myself.
